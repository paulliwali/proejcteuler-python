# (re)Learning Python
 
**Goal:** To build on the foundation of knowledge I currently have on Python and continue to hone my programming skills.
 
I have taken an introductory course on Python/General programming in first year university and an [interactive gaming course](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1) offered by Rice University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - which I highly recommend.
 
**While-at-it Goal:** To learn, *forcefully learn*, to use Vim as my primary development environment for Python. As well becoming comfortable working with Bash.
 
**Resources:**
 
- [Project Euler](projecteuler.net)
- [Hitchhicker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)
- [CLI](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
