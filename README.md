# (re)Learning Python
 
**Goal:** To build on the foundation of knowledge I currently have on Python and continue to hone my programming skills.
 
I have taken an introductory course on Python/General programming in first year university and an [interactive gaming course](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1) offered by Rice University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - which I highly recommend.
 
**While-at-it Goal:** To learn, *forcefully learn*, to use Vim as my primary development environment for Python. As well becoming comfortable working with Bash.
 
My setup for completing the Project Euler problems will by my HP 11" Chromebook with [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) with just the CLI.
 
 
**Resources:**
 
- [Project Euler](projecteuler.net)
- [Hitchhicker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)
- [CLI](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
